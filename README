For this project we used Blender models for the ship, the enemies, and the buildings. The background
and grass were orthographic projections of images. The bullets were also a model. We used SFML for 
our sound purposes. We mapped textures onto the pig enemy. The explosions as well as the ship flashing
when it gets hit utilize transparency. You start with 10 health and it counts your score as you go, 
getting 250 points per enemy killed. We use collision detection to determine if you hit enemies or if 
an enemy hits us. Once you kill a certain number of enemies, a button appears that you can click to kill
all of the enemies on the screen. This uses color mapping and selection. When your health reaches 0, you
get a game over screen and your final score is displayed. If you have any issues getting the code to run,
don't hesitate to e-mail one of us. Have fun!
