For this project we used Blender models for the ship, the enemies, and the buildings. The background
and grass were orthographic projections of images. The bullets were also a model. We used SFML for 
our sound purposes. We mapped textures onto the shark enemy as well as one of the skyscrapers (the black one). 
The explosions as well as the ship flashing when it gets hit utilize transparency. You start with 
10 health and it counts your score as you go, getting 250 points per enemy killed. We use collision 
detection to determine if you hit enemies or if an enemy hits us, which satisfies one of the advanced 
topics we had intended to cover. Once you kill a certain number of enemies, a button appears that you can click to kill
all of the enemies on the screen. This uses color mapping and selection, and satisfies the second advanced topic 
we chose to implement. When your health reaches 0, you get a game over screen and your final score is displayed.
If you have any issues getting the code to run, don't hesitate to e-mail one of us. Have fun!

SFML: We utilize the SFML library to handle sound in the game. A copy of it is included for Mac OS X Lion in this directory,
and you will needed to copy the .framework files from the Frameworks directory in it to 
/Library/Frameworks to install the library on your machine. Additionally, you will need to copy the two 
.framework files from the extlibs directory (freetype.framework and sndfile.framework) to /Library/Frameworks.
Installation instructions can be found here http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.0/start-osx.php. If your OS is older
than Lion, you can go to the Downloads section and install an older version.
