OBJRenderer
===========

OpenGL renderer for OBJ meshes

The OBJ file parser [glm.c and glm.h] have been taken from NateRobins tutorial published on gamedev.net.
[http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/opengl/opengl-tutors-r839]

The code takes an input as an OBJ mesh and renders it using Gouraud shading algorithm.
It doesn't apply any kind of textures referred to in the OBJ mesh.
